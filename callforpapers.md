We invite submissions on all aspects of contact-rich manipulation, with a particular focus on the algorithmic and practical challenges of combining model-based and learning-based approaches.


Submissions should be anonymized and must not exceed 2 pages, following the ICRA format. We encourage authors to include videos, code, or data as supplementary material, either in a zip file or through external anonymized links.

Accepted papers will be presented as either posters presentations and will be archived on the workshop website with the authors' permission. All presentations will take place on-site during the workshop, and currently, we do not plan to offer remote presentation options.
